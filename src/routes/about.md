### Data

Do you have access to some data that would be broadly useful, but don't know the best way to expose it? Get in touch with [contact@blinn.center](mailto:contact@blinn.center) to see if it would be a good fit for Blinn Center. In particular, we're looking for the following data right now:

- Structured course schedule information
  - I've tried scraping the data from the [Dynamic Schedule](https://ssb.blinn.edu:9010/PROD/bwckschd.p_disp_dyn_sched), but there are not-too-infrequent inconsistencies with the data that make it difficult. â€”Piper
